.25 # Shaking range for prediciton (vox)

6 # Maximum absolute change in particle shift (vox) 
100  # Maximum relative change in particle shift (percent) 
1 # A multyplying factor on particle intensity in order to ensure the residual has no traces of tracked particles 
0.01 # lower intensity threshold (xx*avg. Intensity) to eliminate ghost particles while tracking 
0 # Back STB is on for 1
3.5 # the distance between two tracks that are supposed to be the same track
